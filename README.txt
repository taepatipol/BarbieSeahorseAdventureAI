This is an AI implementation of Barbie Seahorse Adventure game by The Olde Battleaxe.

original version of game: http://www.imitationpickles.org/barbie/

This is my senior project of my 4th year in university.
The AI is implemented by NEAT algorithm using NEAT-python.
The game's code have been modified to communicate with AI.
You can replay the trained AI by edit 'lib/main.py' at SELECT_LEVEL to the level you want to replay then run 'python run_game.py' at main folder.
The files that have been modified from the original game are 'main.py', 'level.py', 'player.py', 'agentConnect.py'. 
Hope this repository will be another example of AI implementation in Python game.
If you have questions about this project you can DM me.
